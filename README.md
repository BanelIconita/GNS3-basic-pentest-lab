# GNS3-basic-pentest-lab
Basic pentest lab emulator to run different network attacks from a kali machine.
This is a tiny project I made in order to try out some network attacks. I have manually assigned all ip addresses and networks routes so it might not work for any real life scenario. GNS3 not only allows us to configure networks but acts as an emulator, therefore a VM can be connected to a simulated network and interact with other machines.
